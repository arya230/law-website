                    <h3>Customs Legal Process</h3>
                        <p><strong>Seizure: </strong>Gold suspected to be smuggled is seized by Customs authorities or the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI). This is typically based on intelligence inputs, routine checks, or passenger profiling at airports and border points.</p>
                        <p><strong>Investigation: </strong>A formal investigation follows the seizure. Authorities scrutinize documents, question the accused, and may employ forensic or electronic evidence to establish the nature and intent of the gold possession.</p>
                        <p><strong>Show Cause Notice: </strong>The accused is issued a <strong>Show Cause Notice (SCN)</strong>, detailing the allegations and supporting evidence. This notice invites a legal reply and offers an opportunity to contest the charges.</p>
                        <p><strong>Adjudication: </strong>The case is adjudicated by the <strong>Commissioner of Customs</strong> through a quasi-judicial proceeding, where both sides—Customs and the accused—present their arguments and evidence.</p>
                        <p><strong>Appeals: </strong>If the adjudication order is unfavorable, the matter can be appealed before the <strong>Commissioner (Appeals)</strong>, and subsequently before <strong>CESTAT</strong>, the <strong>High Court</strong>, and the <strong>Supreme Court</strong>, depending on the complexity and outcome.</p>

                    <h3>Core Legal Obligations in International Trade:</h3>
                        <p><strong>Most-Favored-Nation (MFN): </strong>Under WTO agreements, member states are legally obligated to grant all other members treatment as favorable as that given to their “most favored” trading partner. Any advantage offered to one must be extended to all.</p>
                        <p><strong>National Treatment: </strong>Once imported goods enter a national market, they are legally entitled to treatment no less favorable than that afforded to domestically produced goods concerning internal taxation and regulatory frameworks.</p>
                        <p><strong>Promotion of Free Trade: </strong>International trade law generally aims to reduce or eliminate legal barriers to trade, such as tariffs and quotas, to foster the free movement of goods and services between nations.</p>
                        <p><strong>Prevention of Unfair Competition: </strong>Legal rules exist to counteract unfair trade practices like dumping (selling goods internationally below their cost) and subsidies that distort the natural flow of international commerce.</p>
                        <p><strong>Duty of Transparency: </strong>Nations engaged in international trade have a legal obligation to make their trade regulations publicly accessible and to provide relevant information to their trading partners.</p>
